README:
- We have a long way to go on the client side. We have laid the foundations for the site and have spent
  a lot of our time learning the tools that we need to use. 
- We have had some difficulties selecting and manipulating svg images from JavaScript, however these are
  issues that we will try to overcome by changing the <object> tags for <img>.
- Our main challenge on the client side is to integrate a 3D planet using WebGl, however there is a 
  steep learning curve and we are still experimenting. 
- For the server side, we hope to be able to create a user profile that will be retrieved from the
  server.
- There is still lots that we hope to do on the client side including formatting such as, finishing
  title bar, including more content, having a cutomisable character using WebGl or other libraries.
- We also hope to integrate social media APIs such as twitter to allow user's to discuss the event.
- We hope to use the Google Maps API for navigation etc.
